All parts work properly.
For Part 1:
Moderator broadcast a condition variable when it asked the question,
then it waits for another condition variable which will be signalled
by the last commentator. Each commentator who decides to answer or not
write its decision into an array (0 if it decides not to answer,
its id if it will answer). There is also a count of commentators who
reported his decision. Last commentator understands he is the last 
commentator by this count and signals for the moderator to continue.
Since we keep the count of commentators who make a decision instead of
the ones who will answer, we easily handle the 0 answer case.

For part 2:
There is a loop in main which randomly decides whether there is a 
breaking event each second. If there is a breaking event it posts a 
semaphore. Observer waits for this semaphore. When observer observes,
it updetes a variable indicating there is a breaking event. Moderator
looks at that variable before letting commentators to speak. When
there is a breaking event main and moderator waits for a signal from
observer to continue. Observer stops the speaking commentator by signalling
a condition variable.
